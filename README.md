# pong
Pong demo made in Godot

BUGS
====

* Remove ability to pin ball into corner with paddle

TODO
====

* Add Pause
* Add acceleration to the ball; when hit off paddles, acceleration == y component of velocity. Random if y velocity = 0
* Disable collisions bouncing off of sides of paddles (treat them as if they were the front??)
* Make control instructions visible from title screen

FUTURE
======

* Vector field pong
* powerups + de-buffs?
* variable ball speed as game continues?
* Implement CPU paddle
